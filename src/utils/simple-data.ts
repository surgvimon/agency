        Depart from Phuket and cruise in a speedboat across the ocean to the Phi Phi Islands. Enter the picturesque Loh Sama Bay and walk across the sands to relax on Maya Bay. Spot local wildlife at Monkey Beach and indulge in a beach-side restaurant buffet before snorkeling on Bamboo Island.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Get picked up from your hotel in Phuket and travel to the pier to meet your friendly crew and group for the day. Be welcomed onto the boat with a soft drink and seasonal fruits as you're briefed about the tour.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Arrive at Loh Sama Bay, a famous site of Koh Phi Phi Leh. See the small islet in the center and the tiny beach. Next, head to Maya Bay, where they filmed the movie The Beach.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Relax on the white sand beach and explore Maya Bay on your own. As you stroll, appreciate the restoration work around the bay, before heading to Pileh Lagoon, an uninhabited national park. Marvel at this enclosed lagoon's bright emerald waters encircled by towering limestone cliffs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Head down to the cliffs and relax on the hidden beach by the lagoon before continuing to Viking Cave. Discover the historic industry devoted to the harvesting of swiftlet bird nests and learn their importance to Chinese culture.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Next, view the magic of Monkey Beach from the comfort of your boat. Stop at an idyllic spot, surrounded by nature and steep rock formations, and relax in paradise, surrounded by limestone cliffs. Look around to see the wild monkeys climbing the cliffs, relaxing on the beach, or swimming.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Enjoy a delicious international buffet lunch at a beach-side restaurant on Phi Phi Don. After lunch, travel to Nui Bay, a dive site on the northwest coast of Koh Phi Phi Don. Go for a swim in the clear water, if you wish.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Finish your tour with some free time on heart-shaped Bamboo Island, where you will be able to swim, relax, or sunbathe for 1.5 hours. After relaxing, return to your speedboat and enjoy a comfortable transfer back to your hotel.
